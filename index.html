              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                This is a work in progress poolsheet to organize fencing pools.
                Currently, I have used the following
                <a
                  href="https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/document/2857-1927901/Pool_Score_Sheet.pdf"
                  >poolsheet provided by USA Fencing</a
                >
                as a model for creating this one. And it will follow the bout
                orders defined
                <a
                  href="https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/document/0034/5494/bout_order.pdf"
                  >here</a
                >
                (though I do not support setting fencers as teammates right
                now).

              <h2>Usage</h2>
              <p>
                To get started you can click "Add Fencer" and type in a name to
                create a new fencer to add to the poolsheet. You must have 4-12
                fencers for a poolsheet to be created by pressing the "Submit"
                button (Otherwise you will get the "UnsupportedParticipantCount"
                Error). If you want to define your own bout order, you can open
                an issue or pull request in the "fencing-sport-lib" library
                linked above, and I can explain how.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can enter in scores in the number fields, and the checkboxes
                are used to select <em>priority</em> (not the winner). The
                winner is calculated based on the entered score and who has the
                priority box checked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clicking "Get Results" will do the calculations for wins,
                touches scored, touches recieved, and the touch indicator. I
                have a placeholder for displaying place, but it is not used yet.
                For now, just rely on the order the fencers are displayed in.
              </p>
