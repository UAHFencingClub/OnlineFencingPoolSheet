    <h1>Online Fencing Pool Sheet</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      This is a work in progress poolsheet to organize fencing pools.
      Currently, I have used the following 
      <a href="https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/document/2857-1927901/Pool_Score_Sheet.pdf">poolsheet provided by USA Fencing</a>
      as a model for creating this one.
      And it will follow the bout orders defined <a href="https://cdn1.sportngin.com/attachments/document/0034/5494/bout_order.pdf">here</a>
      (though I do not support setting fencers as teammates right now).
    </p>
    <p>
      The source for this page can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/UAHFencingClub/OnlineFencingPoolSheet">Online Fencing Pool Sheet</a>,
      and the supporting library for it can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/UAHFencingClub/fencing-sport-lib">fencing-sport-lib</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      To get started you can click "Add Fencer" and type in a name to create a new fencer to add to the poolsheet.
      You must have 4-12 fencers for a poolsheet to be created by pressing the "Submit" button (Otherwise you will get the "UnsupportedParticipantCount" Error).
      If you want to define your own bout order, you can open an issue or pull request in the "fencing-sport-lib" library linked above, and I can explain how.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can enter in scores in the number fields, and the checkboxes are used to select <em>priority</em> (not the winner).
      The winner is calculated based on the entered score and who has the priority box checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clicking "Get Results" will do the calculations for wins, touches scored, touches recieved, and the touch indicator.
      I have a placeholder for displaying place, but it is not used yet.
      For now, just rely on the order the fencers are displayed in.
    </p>
